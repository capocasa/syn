Syn
===

Syn is a synthesizer, a musical instrument, for Nim. It sounds very good, is lightweight and is suitable for realtime audio.

In its current iteration, it's made up of

- a library containing high quality oscillators and sweepable filters.
- a set of immediately usable presets- which are Nim programs using the building blocks

The process of creating syn patches is much the same as creating a patch for a hardware synth you know well, or writing one in Max/MSP or SuperCollider. You just do it in a Nim program.


What's in a name?
---

Syn is short for synthesizer. It also rings similar to Nim, and reminds you to be appropriately Rock 'n Roll in its use. Or, at your option, to pray for forgiveness.
